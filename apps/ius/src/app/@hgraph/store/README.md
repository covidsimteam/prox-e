# Observable Store Services

This repo uses Dan Wahlin's minimal in size, maximal in awesomeness `ObservableStore`. Here are some key services that this store exposes.

## Invariants

All settings and preferences, and configs, that must remain invariant for the given user session or all sessions, are available via push for all subscibers through the `invariants.service`.


## Ledger

All application history changes and application's contextual changes are available via push for all subscibers through the `ledger.service`.

## History

All application history changes and a log of all historically significant works are available via push for all subscibers through the `history.service`.


## Historical Work

A log of all historically significant works are available via push for all subscibers through the `history-work.service`. 

Historically significant works are defined as those marked as essential works in our specification.


## Herder

A herder is akin to a `ZooKeeper` because it redirects streams to different relevant topic sources based on the topics being currently herded by the `herder.service`.


## Database

The history service uses the `database.service` to persist history updates. 

This history service's `persist` method is used by the Ledger to send the history persist request.

## Transaction

Any exchange with any third party remote service is defined as a transaction. 

`SideEffect<T>` free transactions can often be rolled back whereas `Pure<T>` transactions can always be rolled back. 

All transactions can be monitored by the `transaction.service` if the transaction service and/or annotation is used for a given DB or event queue transaction.
